Version 1.0.1 (in progress)
============================
2005-08-17: efuzzyone		
	    Added OpenGl support (wxGLCanvas), preview frame feature(wxPreviewFrame), printout 
	    features (wxPrintout), and wave file playing support(wxWave).

	    Fixed the bug in samples which while closing the window/quit was causing lisp to crash. When the 
	    application is terminated, the destructor of the wrapper in wxC calls each callback function with
	    null event.
