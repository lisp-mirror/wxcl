[1] There will be only one package named "wxcl" and all the functions(about
2000) and constants (about 3000) will be exported from it.

Use package nick names.
Instead of one package have the following packages:

main-package-name

wxcl
wxcl-windows		
wxcl-dialogs		
wxcl-controls		
wxcl-menus		
wxcl-layout		
wxcl-dc			
wxcl-gdi		
wxcl-ipc		
wxcl-events		
wxcl-validators
wxcl-clipboard
wxcl-logging
wxcl-net
wxcl-printing
wxcl-html
wxcl-stream
wxcl-file
wxcl-thread
wxcl-xml
wxcl-db
wxcl-misc


[2]All the constants will have a leading and trailing '+' sign with
them. Example, wxcl:+default-size+. The constants will be defined using
'defconstant'. 

[3]The wxcl class hierarchy will very closely mirror wxwidgets class
hierarchy. 

[4] All wxcl classes will derive from the abstract class 'object' (wxWidgets
has a similar class called wxObject). The object class contains only one slot.

(defclass object ()
  ((obj :reader object-pointer)))

This slot will hold the pointer to the foreign object of the corresponding
class. 

[5]To create objects of any wxcl class, user should call the make-<class-name>
constructor. For example 

(wxcl:make-frame ....... )

will return an object of the frame class.

[6]The user of the library should not need to know anything about ffi.

[7]The different classes in wxcl should be organized in the proper inheritance
hierarchy. So, for example the 'show' method specializes on objects of class
'window', and all the widget classes inherits from the class 'window'. Hence, the
method 'show' should work on all the widget classes also.

(setf fr (wxcl:make-frame ....... ))
(show fr)

this should work because class frame inherits the window class.

[8]The getter methods in wxWidgets will have their 'get' prefix stripped off in
wxcl. For example, wxWidgets function 'getSize' will be just 'size' in wxcl,
and it will return an object of the size class.
For most of the setter methods the writer method is specialized, so setSize
can be called as 
  (setf (size fr) (make-size :width 500 :height 600))

[9]wxWidget setter functions which sets a particular item in a list, for
example 
wxControlWithItems::SetClientObject
void SetClientObject(int n, wxClientData *data)

the equivalent wxcl function will be called as
  (let ((lb (make-list-box ....))
        (cl (make-client-object.....))) 
    (setf (client-object lb 3) cl))

[10]There maybe some functions which are exception to the above rule. 

[11]The optional arguments in wxWidgets will be provided as keyword
arguments. 

[12]The classes 'size' and 'position' defined in wxCL should provide same
functionality as corresponding classes in wxWidgets but they are entirely
implemented in lisp.

[13]The wxWidgets predicates which return bool will map to a similar predicate
in wxcl, except they will have a '-p' suffix, and they will return t or nil.

[14]All classes and preferably functions too should have a documentation string
describing them. 

[15]Have a sexp based style of defining frames, and other widgets.
