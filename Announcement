wxCL aims to provide an industrial strength GUI library to application

operating system platforms. It builds upon wxWidgets, a comprehensive
C++ library that provides uniform application interface to all major
GUI platforms; including  GTK, Windows, X11, and MacOS X.

The current release of wxCL 1.1.0 runs on CLISP, and is tested on
Windows XP but it should work on Linux and Mac OS X as well (not
