Announcement: wxCL 1.1.0  (August 21, 2005) ***
 ---------------------------

 <http://www.wxcl-project.org>

We are pleased to announce the release wxCL-1.1.1 (Alpha), the latest
installment in wxCL development effort. This release now includes 
wxWidgets 2.6.2 dll. There are also a number of bug fixes, and some
api enhancements. This version is more stable with native clisp on Windows XP. 
Please see the Release Notes for complete list of changes. 
Please read the quick start guide before using this version as using the 2.6.2 
dll requires you to close the library every time you finish the program. Also, 
don't forget to take a look at the cvs version of wxGlade, 
(http://wxglade.sourceforge.net/) which provides a cool way of creating 
wxCL GUI's.

What is wxCL?
-------------

wxCL aims to provide an industrial strength GUI library to application
programmers which is portable across Common Lisp implementations and
operating system platforms. It builds upon wxWidgets, a comprehensive
C++ library that provides uniform application interface to all major
GUI platforms; including  GTK, Windows, X11, and MacOS X. 

Availability:
-------------

The current release of wxCL 1.1.1 runs on CLISP, and is tested on
Windows XP but it should work on Linux and Mac OS X as well (not
tested due to lack of resources). 

It can be downloaded from:
