Announcement: wxCL 1.3.0  (May 20, 2006) ***
 ---------------------------

 <http://www.wxcl-project.org>

We are pleased to announce the release wxCL-1.3.0 (Alpha), the latest
installment in wxCL development effort. In this release wxCL now
uses CFFI as a backend. Since the CFFI bindings are new, there may be
still many bugs.

What is wxCL?
-------------

wxCL aims to provide an industrial strength GUI library to application
programmers which is portable across Common Lisp implementations and
operating system platforms. It builds upon wxWidgets, a comprehensive
C++ library that provides uniform application interface to all major
GUI platforms: including  GTK, Windows, X11, and MacOS X. 

Availability:
-------------

The current release of wxCL 1.3.0 should run on all the common lisp
implementations supported by CFFI. Although, tested only on
Windows XP but it should work on Linux and Mac OS X as well (not
tested due to lack of resources). If you face any problem on any platform
or common lisp implementation, feel free to contact us on the mailing list, 
we will try to help you.

It can be downloaded from:
