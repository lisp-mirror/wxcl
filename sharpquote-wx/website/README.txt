Although we are still in the process of publishing the website
generation code step by step (which includes factoring out
inline styles and parameterizing the website generator),
changes made to the files already contained here *do* 
affect the rendering of the site, because
the files are linked into the rendering environment.

A good starting point to understand the workings of the
generator is reading the file ./preferences/website.ini .
