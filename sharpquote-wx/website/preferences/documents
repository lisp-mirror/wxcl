;;; -*- Mode: LISP; Base: 10; Syntax: Common-Lisp -*-




;;;; Files (documents) are *not* copied to the server wxcl-project.org,
;;;; rather a link is generated that points to SourceForge's viewcvs
;;;; service.
;;;;
;;;; This implies that visitors will see either the latest version
;;;; of the file as it sits in the CVS tree, or, if a certain version
;;;; is refered in the topic tree, this specific version.
;;;;
;;;; This convention was choosen to encourage authors to keep the
;;;; documents in the wxCL CVS tree.
;;;;
;;;; (However, considerations go on if a means to link to external
;;;; documents should be provided for the topic tree rather than
;;;; for a link tab, presenting exclusivly external links and documents.)
;;;; 
;;;; 
;;;;
;;;; File locations are given in a notation that is
;;;; similar to the Structured Directory notation of Common Lisp;
;;;; see CLtL2 § 23.1.3 and CLHS § 19.2.2.4.3 .
;;;;
;;;; The conventions for this file differ in the following way from 
;;;; the standard:
;;;;
;;;; 1 - Drop the :relative or :absolute key from the front of the
;;;;     list -- everything is relative to the root of the CVS tree.
;;;;
;;;; 2 - To denote file locations, replace the NIL of the last cons of
;;;;     the Structured Directory notation with the file name;
;;;;     that is, turn the Structured Directory list into a dotted list
;;;;     with the file name string being the element behind the dot.
;;;; 
;;;;     Example: Instead of  "./docs/index.html"
;;;;              write       ("docs" . "index.html")
;;;;
;;;;
;;;; The topic tree is represented using nested lists.
;;;; If the list head is string, the string is used to generate XHTML 
;;;; for the section header.
;;;; If the list head is a key, it is used to look up a translation
;;;; in the dictionary files (dict.en, dict.de, ...) Note that the key used
;;;; must also be registered in the file dict.keys, otherwise it is
;;;; rejected when the dictionaries are loaded.
;;;; If the list head is a list, 1st =  key, rest = list of modifiers
;;;;
;;;;
