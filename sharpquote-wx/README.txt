This directory -- the CVS module 'sharpquote-wx' -- contains
things that are a little off the track of the main line
release process, like website generation, the work on an
alternate object system, and on pragmatic syntax generators 
and matchers with an uniform interface that can aid in 
generating both the website and C/CL or CPP/CL glueing code.

Note: sharpquote-wx (or sqwx or #'wx) is the name of a
CVS module, not a development branch.
