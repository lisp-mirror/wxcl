# Three different line formats are valid:
#	key	-a    aliases...
#	key [options] directory
#	key [options] directory files...
#
# Where "options" are composed of:
#	-i prog		Run "prog" on "cvs commit" from top-level of module.
#	-o prog		Run "prog" on "cvs checkout" of module.
#	-e prog		Run "prog" on "cvs export" of module.
#	-t prog		Run "prog" on "cvs rtag" of module.
#	-u prog		Run "prog" on "cvs update" of module.
#	-d dir		Place module in directory "dir" instead of module name.
#	-l		Top-level directory only -- do not recurse.
#
# NOTE:  If you change any of the "Run" options above, you'll have to
# release and re-checkout any working directories of these modules.
#
# And "directory" is a path to a directory relative to $CVSROOT.
#
# The "-a" option specifies an alias.  An alias is interpreted as if
# everything on the right of the "-a" had been typed on the command line.
#
# You can encode a module within a module by using the special '&'
# character to interpose another module into the current module.  This
# can be useful for creating a module that consists of many directories
# spread out over the entire source repository.




# renamed full rather than wxcl because it is used to export the whole
#  CVS repository anyway. This could be done without this module definition
#  but is kept here for reasons of documentation.
#  The CVS snapshot cronjob of SF user joerg_pr uses this module alias to
#  generate all three types of snapshots: the FULL snapshot (used to
#  generate the webpage, because the document definitions for the
#  website generator may collect files from outside of sharpquote-wx),
#  the WXCL snapshot which contains everything but CVSROOT and 
#  sharpquote-wx, and the SQWX snapshot which contains sharpquote-wx only.

full	-a	.



# Although no longer used to produce the sqwx CVS snapshot by cronjob 
#  of SF user joerg_pr, this module definition is kept here for reasons
#  of documentation and as a convenient hook to make manual cvs exports
#  of this module alone.
#
#  (sharpquote-wx is the name of a CVS module, not a development branch.)
