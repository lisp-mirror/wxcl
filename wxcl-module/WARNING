PLEASE NOTE:

The files in this folder are *NOT* the same that are in the clisp-wrappers 
folder. The ones you find here are for linking wxCL with CLISP and are,
probably, not so new as the ones in the clisp-wrappers directory. This is
due to the fact that I have not created an automatic way of generating
these wrappers from the original ones.
