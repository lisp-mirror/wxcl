wxCL 1.1.0
----------
To see the instructions on how to use this library, look at the
`index.html` file in the doc folder.

I wasn't able to make much headway into generating the html
documentaion for wxcl. I could not get jade to compile on my window
box, and it seems albert also had some problems.

But, I am including the xml file which was generated by Albert, if
you have any success in generating the docs, please contact us on the
wxcl mailing list.

Licence information

For licensing information, please see the files:

Although this may seem complex, it is there to allow authors of
proprietary/commercial applications to use wxCL and wxWidgets in addition
to those writing GPL'ed applications. In summary, the licence is
LGPL plus a clause allowing unrestricted distribution of
application binaries. To answer a FAQ, you don't have to
distribute any source if you wish to write commercial
applications using wxWidgets. 

However, if you distribute wxGTK or wxMotif (with Lesstif)
version of your application, don't forget that it is linked
against GTK+ (or Lesstif) which is covered by LGPL *without*
exception notice. Under Linux systems your app is probably linked
against LGPL glibc as well. Please read carefully LGPL, section
6. which describes conditions for distribution of closed source
applications linked against LGPL library. Basically you should
link dynamically and include source code of LGPL libraries with
your product (unless it is already present in user's system -
like glibc usually is). If compiled with --enable-odbc (Unix
only), wxWidgets library will contain iODBC library which is
covered by LGPL.

If you use TIFF image handler, please see src/tiff/COPYRIGHT
for libtiff licence details.

If you use JPEG image handler, documentation for your program
should contain following sentence: "This software is based in
part on the work of the Independent JPEG Group". See
src/jpeg/README for details.

If you use wxRegEx class on a system without native regular
expressions support (i.e. MS Windows), see src/regex/COPYRIGHT
file for Henry Spencer's regular expression library copyright.

If you use wxXML classes or XRC, see src/expat/COPYING for licence details.
